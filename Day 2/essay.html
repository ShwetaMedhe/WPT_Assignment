            <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the creation of intelligent machines that can learn, reason, and solve problems like humans, impacting industries from healthcare to finance through applications like virtual assistants, self-driving cars, and advanced data analysis. While AI offers significant benefits such as increased efficiency, personalized learning, and solutions to complex problems, it also presents challenges, including ethical concerns around data privacy, the potential loss of jobs, and the need for responsible development and regulation to ensure its use aligns with human well-being.</p>
